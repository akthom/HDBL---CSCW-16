**Introduction**

For decades, databases – particularly relational databases – have been a fixture of the modern workplace, and a key site of cooperative work. Yet despite their longevity and omnipresence, relatively little research has been conducted by the CSCW community (with a few notable exceptions, described further below) exploring how, exactly, cooperative work is done with and around relational databases; how databases structure the work that is or can done with them (and vice versa); and how that work changes over time. 

We can imagine a few reasons for this lack of attention: databases (particularly the relational kind) have been around long enough to be assumed a “solved” problem; much of database work is done by people alone in cubicles, giving it the appearance of independence rather than cooperativeness; and long term information system use is inherently difficult to study. Further, the end of the relational database has been predicted since the 1990s at least (e.g. Atzeni et al., 2013), perhaps placing it in a sort of anticipatory blindspot: why study something that probably won’t be around in another five years?

We argue that the reports of the relational database’s death are greatly exaggerated.  While object-oriented, XML or NoSQL solutions may well prevail in some places, relational databases – particularly “desktop” databases that aren’t necessarily stored on a server – still occupy an important middle-range niche: they are used by small groups of (often relation-savvy) users who want or need more structural complexity than flat-file spreadsheet programs such as Excel, yet do not necessarily require enterprise-level installation or adoption. Further, they have become particularly important to scientific research, where they variously function as infrastructure for information storage and retrieval; as analytical tools; as first class research objects in and of themselves; or as any combination of the above.

Other rather mundane technologies such as email and spreadsheets have received attention [Belotti, Nardi etc.] This work reminds us of the innovative ways that people may adopt, adapt, tailor and appropriate a technology to meet particular needs. We believe that databases should also be considered in this way.



In this work, we study databases by bringing E. F. Codd in conversation with Stewart Brand: looking at databases and the logical schemas that underlie them in the same way that Brand looked at buildings, and how they change (or “learn” in Brand’s words) from their surroundings, contents and use over time.  This framing provides us with a way of not only looking at how the structures of databases affects the work that is done with them, but how that work, in turn, affects database structure over time.  A longitudinal view here is necessary because the rhythms of information work cannot be encapsulated by only one instance; further,  


In this paper, we want to emphasize that database use, maintenance and migration – particularly over the long-term – is indeed cooperative work, and show that this work has certain important properties – notably in that it is particularly influenced by the underlying information models and data structures in relational databases.  Further, we want to show that the process of curating and controlling both data and data models alike is one that CSCW should pay attention to: in other words, that data curation is a problem for CSCW, and a CSCW perspective will make data curation better.



Research questions: 
How do databases shape work practices, and vice versa?
How is relational database software adapted for use in contexts where there is no clearcut division between administrators and users?
What gaps are there between user needs of databases and the technical capabilities of current systems?
