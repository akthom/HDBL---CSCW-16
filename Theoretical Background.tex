\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Codd}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tripartite model (ANSI)
\item Logical modeling as a CSCW issue
\begin{itemize}
\item Relational model as designed for distinct user/administrator roles
\item Lots of discussion of need for data independence between physical/logical levels – what about logical/conceptual? How do those interact?
\item And what about logical structure and day-to-day work practices? How do those interact?
\item Note related work in HCI/CSCW - Batra 1993; Topi & Ramish 2003; more
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Brand}

\begin{itemize}
\item Brand gives us a framework to start answering those questions
\item	it's unintuitive that a building learns from its inhabitants and vice versa’ Equally unintuitive is that conceptual and logical levels learn form one another (e.g. that databases and people learn from each other)
\item Brand’s 6 S’s as they translate to databases
\item Include figure showing table growth over time
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The nature of natural history work}

We have chosen natural history museums as the focus for this case study because they are an excellent "model organism" for [the kind of database work we will have presumably described above]. NHM work -- particularly, that done by collections managers (CMs) -- is deeply technosocial: it involves mediating between physical specimen collections (these can range from fossils to sea shells to whole organisms preserved in alcohol, depending on the discipline), paper records, relational databases and anticipated future information technology; and between volunteers, external IT staff, curators\footnote{we note that in NHMs, the "curator" tends to do less curation in the sense of physically caring for specimens and their data, but rather functions more like a researcher administrator: writing papers and grants, and making policy decisions. Collections managers are typically in charge of the the actual day-to-day maintenance of collections and databases.}, visiting researchers, and other departments. Thus, any given day’s work will involve some combination of wrangling both people and information structures. Indeed, each CM we spoke with for this research spends anywhere from 40-80\% of her time working with databases (typically closer to the latter) or supervising/checking the work of volunteers working with databases.

Ideally, collections databases would act as both an index to the physical collection, and a dataset from which researchers could draw: listing the name and catalog number of each specimen, as well as additional contextualizing data such as the name of its original collector and the location from which it was collected. However, electronic databases are partial at best. Many museums are still working to "digitize", or transcribe, their paper records into databases; these paper records may take the form of bound catalog ledgers, card catalogs, labels or jars, or most confoundingly, tiny pieces of paper stuck under bugs on pins [REF - something from Zookeys digi issue] (this is sometimes referred to as "databasing" the collection). Further, even complete transcription won't create a complete index, because the vast majority of museum collections are \textit{not} fully cataloged. It is estimated that just 9\% of total collections worldwide have been digitized -- meaning that another 1.2 billion remain, essentially undocumented [REF and rephrase and check these stats \cite{Ari_o_2010}].

Thus, it's easy to -- but important to not -- underestimate the scale of NHM collections, and consequently, the scale of extremely dispersed (both in time and space) amount of collaborative work that supports their preservation.
NHM collections workers display a uniquely long view of information preservation, collaboration and curation.

[something from the AAm about preserving things in perpetuity] Many physical collections are hundreds of years old -- as is their documentation -- 
Electronic collections databases are often decades years old; and really, hundreds, if paper catalog ledgers are included!) and linked with researchers and collections worldwide.  

 While many collections include similar information in their records – for instance, a catalog number, a specimen’s scientific name, a description of the locality from which it was collected – the way in which this data is recorded is often quite idiosyncratic to an institution’s local cataloging rules and practices, as well as to the domain of study; as a result, collections management databases often have correspondingly idiosyncratic legacy data structures.

Thus, while there are now a number of database systems designed specifically for NHMs

(NHMs have been surprisingly early adopters of computer technology in many ways)
collections management databases aren’t created and maintained for their own sake; they’re first and foremost a tool to facilitate the management and use of physical specimen collections.
