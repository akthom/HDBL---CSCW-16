**Intro:**

*	Describe the pervasivenesss & many roles of relational databases – and briefly note that they have been understudied from a CSCW perspective 
    *	In a world…. Where we can’t stop talking about big data…. This. Thing. Needs. To be studied.
*	Databases are inherently a CSCW concern: consider the Relations and relationships quote from Codd – our desire is to make this inherent-ness more visible
    *	Mind the Ackerman Sociotechnical gap: the gap btwn what we know we can support technical and what we can support practically
    *	So there’s a big gap still, in Codd’s vision, that hasn’t been closed despite 40 years of innovation
    *	Just as the divide btwn users and designers of software has broken down, so is the divide between database users and administrators
*	Set up the conceptual/logical model – and talk about how we’re going to make a connection between what have been 2 domains of concern. 
    *	Domain 1: Logical modeling/
        *	This is just as important as conceptual modeling (e.g. systems analysis, requirements gathering) to studies of work
        *	The importance of data independence extends beyond just the physical/logical split – needs to be considered in the logical/conceptual split as well
    *	Domain 2: Studies of work rhythms/work over time –
        *	 Looking at how structures influence work (and vice versa) is something that has to be done over time; the changes accrete slowly, and over the long term, are often (we posit) punctuated by migration to new copmuters/systems
        *	database migration is a largely un-studied thing for data curation and CSCW alike
        *	Preview Brand framework here – his idea of shearing lets us look at this co-structuration in a more methodical way
    *	We contribute to recent work looking at rhythms at work, but by taking a more object-centered perspective.
*	Why we’re looking at NHMs
    *	Difference btwn users and admins is negligible
    *	Databases hold many roles: research tool, digital preservation, transaction processing and tracking
    *	Vested interested in preserving and migrating databases over time
    *	Andrea has 10 years of experience in the field
*	Contributions of this work
    *	Identify issues with logical modeling that are of concern for CSCW
    *	Contribute to studies of rhythms of work, but from a perspective focused on infrastructure (databases)
    *	Show that CSCW can inform data curation
    *	Hope to begin identifying gaps between user needs of relational databases and the technical capabilities of current systems (cite Ackerman?)

**Background theoretical foundations:**

*	Codd:
    *	Tripartite model (ANSI)
    *	Logical modeling as a CSCW issue
    *	Relational model as designed for distinct user/administrator roles
    *	Lots of discussion of need for data independence between physical/logical levels – what about logical/conceptual? How do those interact?
	    *	And what about logical structure and day-to-day work practices? How do those interact?
    	*	Note related work in HCI/CSCW
*	Brand: 
    *	Brand gives us a framework to start answering those questions
    *	its unintuitive that a building learns from its inhabitants and vice versa’ Equally unintuitive is that conceptual and logical levels learn form one another (e.g. that databases and people learn from each other)
    *	Brand’s 6 S’s as they translate to databases
		*	Include figure showing table growth over time
*	Other related work in CSCW 
	*	Work rhythms
	*	Other databases studies
*	We seek to contribute to this work by bridging these existing studies of infrastructure and work with databases with analysis of how database structures affect work over time – and what steps users take to maintain and curate data structures over time.  In short, we will show the mutual constitution of data models and work practices.

**Method (4 paragraphs)**

* include some sort of description of who we’re going to talk about (demographics)
* propositions:

**Cases**

Make sure to tie up the quotes – 

**Discussion**

*	So what does this tell us about how we study these things? And conceptual / logical levels in datbases in general? Where should we study this again? Does conceptual and logical have differentiation in other platforms (e.g. social media platforms, hypertext)
*	Curation as a concern for CSCW and vice versa
