**Introduction**

For decades, databases – particularly relational databases – have been a fixture of the modern workplace, and a key site of cooperative work.. Yet despite their longevity and omnipresence, relatively little research has been conducted by the CSCW community (with a few notable exceptions, described further below) exploring how, exactly, cooperative work is done with and around relational databases; how databases structure the work that is or can done with them (and vice versa); and how that work changes over time.   This latter question – how work with databases is done over long periods of time – is of particular importance, given that databases are fundamentally tasked with facilitating information storage and retrieval for indefinite periods of time.  

We can imagine a few reasons for this lack of attention: databases (particularly the relational kind) have been around long enough to be assumed a “solved” problem; much of database work is done by people alone in cubicles, giving it the appearance of independence rather than cooperativeness; and long term information system use is inherently difficult to study. Further, the end of the relational database has been predicted since the 1990s at least (e.g. Atzeni et al., 2013), perhaps placing it in a sort of anticipatory blindspot: why study something that probably won’t be around in another five years?

We argue that the reports of the relational database’s death are greatly exaggerated.  While object-oriented, XML or NoSQL solutions may well prevail in some places, relational databases – particularly “desktop” databases that aren’t necessarily stored on a server – still occupy an important middle-range niche: they are used by small groups of (often relation-savvy) users who want or need more structural complexity than flat-file spreadsheet programs such as Excel, yet do not necessarily require enterprise-level installation or adoption. Further, they have become particularly important to scientific research, where they variously function as infrastructure for information storage and retrieval; as analytical tools; as first class research objects in and of themselves; or as any combination of the above.

Other rather mundane technologies such as email and spreadsheets have received attention [Belotti, Nardi etc.] This work reminds us of the innovative ways that people may adopt, adapt, tailor and appropriate a technology to meet particular needs. We believe that databases should also be considered in this way.

In this paper, we want to emphasize that database use, maintenance and migration – particularly over the long-term – is indeed cooperative work, and show that this work has certain important properties – notably in that it is particularly influenced by the underlying information models and data structures in relational databases.  Further, we want to show that the process of curating and controlling both data and data models alike is one that CSCW should pay attention to: in other words, that data curation is a problem for CSCW, and a CSCW perspective will make data curation better.

To make these arguments, we present a multiple case study of databases used and managed by natural history collections managers, as they have been used over time.  NHM’s are a great model organism because...
-	These databases are not only used collaboratively (e.g. operated, managed and updated by multiple people in coordination), but used to support collaborative ex silico work: cooperative management of information & resources that exist outside of the computer.  
-	NHM work w/DB’s overlaps with scientific database use, in some helpful ways (trying to do research it differs in a few key ways – particularly that museum database use tends to be for extremely long periods of time.  Depending on our definition of “database” it might be argued that some of these information systems are hundreds of years old.
-	cooperative work in museums requires balancing research and public interest – and working across those is really productive

Research questions: 
•	How do people collaborate using databases, particularly over long periods of time?
•	How do administrators maintain and migrate a database’s structure over time, and how does that migration effect the work that is or can be done with the database?’
•	How do database practices shape scientific practices?
•	How do legacy software and legacy data structures affect research and curatorial activities? 
•	How has relational database software been adapted to support a new model of collaborative work vs. the old. (e.g. administrator-users vs. users)
